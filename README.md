## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## Acknowledgments

Shout out to Kevin Powell on this one. He explains how he approaches and thinks through the design. He emphasises semantic HTML and it was a good project to review SASS. Great teacher and channel that I highly recommend.
